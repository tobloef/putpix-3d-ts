### 3D software rasterizer written in TypeScript ðŸŸ¦

## Goals

* This project follows my [Wheel Reinventor's Principles](https://github.com/tobloef/wheel-reinventors-principles): In short, it's made from scratch for learning and to tailor it to my specific use cases.
* Learn the maths behind 3D projection and simple point lights.
* Write an OBJ parser to load 3D models.
* No graphics library or GPU usage. Just drawing one pixel at a time. Performance is a non-goal!
